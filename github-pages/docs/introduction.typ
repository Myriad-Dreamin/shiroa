= Introduction

*typst-book* is a command line tool to create books with Typst. It has similar use cases as #link("https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html")[mdBook], which is ideal for creating product or API documentation, tutorials, course materials or anything that requires a clean, easily navigable and customizable presentation.

*typst-book* is heavily inspired by mdBook, but it is considered to be more adapted to Typst style, hence no guarantee of compatibility with mdBook.
